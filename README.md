# Image Hosting
I don't know why you're here, but welcome to my CDN! I host random images here (you'll maybe find shitposts)

## How it is used
This is using [PicGo](https://picgo.github.io/PicGo-Doc/en/guide/). You can find the images on [the repository](https://github.com/TheUltiOne/cdn/tree/main/img). You can add your own images, fork this and create a new folder with your name inside of img, where you can add your images once I accept your pull request :)
